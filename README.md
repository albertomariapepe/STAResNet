A same set of PDEs can be expressed in different algebras. We focus on Maxwell's PDEs, which can be formulated in 2D and 3D GA (for the 2D and 3D case), but also in 3D and 4D 
**Spacetime Algebra (STA)**. It is known in the literature that a STA formulation of Maxwell's PDEs is much more compact and elegant, as well as easier to compute (Lasenby, 2020). We demonstrated how this holds true also for **Clifford Algebra Networks** that work with STA multivectors as opposed to vanilla GA. 

STAResNet is our own ResNet-like Clifford Algebra Network that represents inputs, weights and biases as STA multivectors. We showed how solving Maxwell's PDEs via our STAResNet outperforms Clifford ResNet (Brandstetter et al., 2022) which works in 3D GA.




## Achievements ðŸ’«

- ðŸŒŸ Extended experiments of Brandstetter et al. on Maxwell's PDEs to the 2D case
- ðŸŒŸ Implemented 3D convolutional layers for *any* algebra of *any* dimension in TensorFlow
- ðŸŒŸ Implemented a network working *exclusively* with objects in Spacetime Algebra
- ðŸŒŸ Demonstrated how STAResNet solves PDEs more accurately than Clifford ResNet both in 2D and 3D space
- ðŸŒŸ Showed how STAResNet is more resilient in presence of obstacles, either seen or unseen
- ðŸŒŸ Achieved up to 2.6 lower MSE error between GT and esitmated fields with 6 times fewer trainable parameters as opposed to 

We can conclude that choice of the algebra, when implementing Clifford Networks, is key for more lightweight, descriptive and accurate networks that are grounded in the physics of the problem and represent a more natural parametrisation of the chosen problem.
